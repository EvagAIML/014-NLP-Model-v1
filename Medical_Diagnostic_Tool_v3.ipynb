        "\n",
        "### Business Context\n",
        "The healthcare industry is rapidly evolving, with professionals facing increasing challenges in managing vast volumes of medical data while delivering accurate and timely diagnoses. The need for quick access to comprehensive, reliable, and up-to-date medical knowledge is critical for improving patient outcomes and ensuring informed decision-making in a fast-paced environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Healthcare professionals often encounter information overload, struggling to sift through extensive research and data to create accurate diagnoses and treatment plans. This challenge is amplified by the need for efficiency, particularly in emergencies, where time-sensitive decisions are vital. Furthermore, access to trusted, current medical information from renowned manuals and research papers is essential for maintaining high standards of care.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objective\n",
        "As an AI specialist, the task is to develop a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** solution using renowned medical manuals to address healthcare challenges. The objective is to **understand** issues like information overload, **apply** AI techniques to streamline decision-making, **analyze** its impact on diagnostics and patient outcomes, **evaluate** its potential to standardize care practices, and **create** a functional prototype demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.\n",
        "\n",

        "1. **RAG Efficiency:** The implementation of RAG significantly improves the reliability of the medical assistant by grounding answers in the trusted Merck Manual.\n",
        "2. **Parameter Importance:** Tuning the chunk retrieval size (k) and temperature is crucial. `k=3` provided a good balance of context without overwhelming the model window.\n",
        "3. **Prompt Engineering:** Specifying a persona (e.g., \"Medical Assistant\") helps maintain a professional tone suitable for healthcare applications.\n",
        "4. **Evaluation:** The automated evaluation showed high relevance, validating the system's utility for diagnostic assistance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Business Recommendations\n",
        "- **Deployment:** Deploy this prototype to a pilot group of clinicians to assist with information retrieval.\n",
        "- **Data Expansion:** Integrate more specialized journals apart from the Merck Manual for wider coverage.\n",
        "- **User Interface:** Build a frontend (Streamlit/React) to allow doctors to query easily from tablets."
